* laptops-sales-py
*A program that can help a laptop shop keep track of laptops/computers bought from manufacturers and sold to various customers which may be individuals or companies. This was a college project for the module "Introduction to Computing" in the First Year of my college.*

** Pull the git repo and launch the program:
#+begin_src bash
git pull https://github.com/manish-koirala/laptops-sales-py
cd laptops-sales-py
python main.py
#+end_src

** Usage:
After launching the program, the user is greeted with four options. 
1) Buy items to the stock
2) Sell items from the stock
3) Display items info in the stock
4) Exit the program

The information about the laptops in the stock is maintained inside stock/stock.txt file. When new laptops are bought or sold, a unique invoice is generated inside the invoices/sales
or invoice/purchases directory.
